Welcome to Task Hammer, the application that keeps track of your to-do list.  Once signed up and logged in, a user can keep track of all of his or her upcoming tasks
and once completed, these tasks can be marked as "hammered."  This will move them into a category of completed tasks!  A user can create, read, update, and delete any tasks.  


## Install Instructions
1. In order to install, a new user will want to clone the github repo onto their local environment. 
2. A user will need to change directories to the task-hammer file.
3. A user will then need to go to the command line and type the following commands:
    1. ```gem install bundler```- installs the bundler gem which will assist with installing all other gems noted in the gemfile. 
    2. ```bundle install``` running this command installs all required gems onto the user's local environment
    3. ```shotgun``` starts up a local server so that the application can be used
4. A user will now need to go to their browser and type in:
    . "localhost:9393"- this is the port utilized by shotgun and will start at the root route/welcome page.
5. A user can now use the Task Hammer app to keep track of their to-do list.  Enjoy!
